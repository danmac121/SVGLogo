# SVG Logo Generator

## Description
This SVG logo generator runs in the user's local terminal and can be initialized by typing node index.mjs into the terminal. When a user enters this line in the terminal they will first be presented with a list of shapes to choose from. When the user selects their shape, they will be prompted to enter either the name of a color or a hexadecimal value for that color. They will then be prompted to do the same for the text that will appear within the shape, and finally they will be asked to enter the text they wish to see in the shape. The user's inputs are then set within the template literal which is used to generate the shape.svg file. 

## Installation
To use this svg logo generator, clone down the code, open index.mjs in the local terminal and run the node index.mjs command. 

## Tests
I wrote four tests for this code, three of which ensure the render function returns properly for all three shapes and a fourth test to ensure the setColor method properly applies the user's selected color to the shape.
